Interactive operating characteristics explorer for bhmbasket basket trials.
Simulates multi-cohort basket designs over grids of sample size and evidence level, computes Type I error and power for different borrowing methods (e.g. stratified, berry), and visualises feasible regions and decision boundaries with interactive Plotly plots (coarse/fine grids, method toggles, feasibility filters). The number of cohorts is user-specified.
