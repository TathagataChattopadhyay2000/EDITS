negateGoDecisions
Description
Negates the go decisions derived with getGoDecisions.

Usage
negateGoDecisions(go_decisions_list, overall_min_nogos = "all")
Arguments
go_decisions_list	
An object of class decision_list, as returned by getGoDecisions

overall_min_nogos	
Either a non-negative integer or the string all for the minimum number of cohort-level NoGo decisions required for an overall NoGo decision, Default: all

Details
This function is intended for implementing decision rules with a consider zone as e.g. proposed in "Bayesian design of proof-of-concept trials" by Fisch et al. (2015). This approach involves two criteria, Significance and Relevance.

Significance: high evidence that the treatment effect is greater than some smaller value (e.g. treatment effect under H0)

Relevance: moderate evidence that the treatment effect is greater than some larger value (e.g. treatment effect under a certain alternative)

The decision for a cohort is then taken as follows:

Go decision: Significance and Relevance

Consider decision: either Significance, or Relevance, but not both

NoGo decision: no Significance and no Relevance

In the example below, the following criteria for are implemented for each of the three cohorts:

Significance: 
P
(
p
j
>
0.4
)
>
0.95
P(p 
j
​
 >0.4)>0.95

Relevance: 
P
(
p
j
>
0.8
)
>
0.5
P(p 
j
​
 >0.8)>0.5

Value
A list of NoGo decisions of class decision_list
