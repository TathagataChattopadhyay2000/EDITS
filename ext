Coverage Analytics
Codecov analyzes your coverage reports
 to help you identify untested code and improve test effectiveness. Before integrating with Codecov, ensure your project generates coverage reports, as Codecov relies on these reports for coverage analysis.

Select a setup option

Using GitHub Actions

Using Circle CI

Using Codecov's CLI
Step 1: Output a Coverage report file in your CI
Select your language below to generate your coverage reports. If your language isn't listed, visit our supported languages doc
 for example repositories. Codecov generally supports XML and JSON formats.


Jest
Install requirements in your terminal:

npm install --save-dev jest

In a GitHub Action, run tests and generate a coverage report:

npx jest --coverage

Step 2: Select an upload token to add as a secret on GitHub-optional

Repository token
Use it for uploading coverage reports in the SPARKS-FOUNDATION-TASK-1 repository.

Step 3: add token as repository secret
Codecov requires a token to authenticate uploading your coverage reports. Organization admin required to access organization settings > secrets and variables > actions

CODECOV_TOKEN

cafc8da5-e6ea-4372-8210-f4f211c0f7a7


Your organization secret in GitHub should look like this:

Step 4: Add Codecov to your GitHub Actions workflow yaml file
After tests run, this will upload your coverage report to Codecov:

- name: Upload coverage reports to Codecov
    uses: codecov/codecov-action@v5
    with:
      token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}


Your final GitHub Actions workflow for a project using Jest could look something like this:

Step 5: merge to main or your preferred feature branch
Once merged to your default branch, subsequent pull requests will have Codecov checks and comments. Additionally, you'll find your repo coverage dashboard here. If you have merged, try reloading the page.
